= Bioportal Gem

A simple Gem for using the Bioportal API.

This version was a cut-back implementation of a previous version that used the old BioPortal API. It was cut-back just to support
the needs of the Seek for Science project - http://seek4science.org

It supports simple searching and fetching details about a class in an ontology.
